## 🔹 Features

- **Multiple CLI Projects in One Solution**  
  Each project is self-contained but can share common code through the solution.

- **Supported Operations (Example Projects)**  
  - Matrix operations (addition, multiplication, determinant, inversion, etc.)  
  - File utilities (if implemented in future projects)  
  - Crypto or math tools (expandable)  

- **Interactive Command-Line Interfaces**  
  All projects are built using standard C# console applications, optionally enhanced with [Spectre.Console](https://spectreconsole.net/) for menus and prompts.
